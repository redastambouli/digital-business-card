# digital-business-card

[digital-business-card](https://redastambouli.github.io/digital-business-card/) is my first React app. I set up the project locally with Vite. 
The app is just a simple static webpage styled with some CSS properties.

This is the first solo project for section one from the React course: [React Course - Beginner's Tutorial for React JavaScript Library [2022]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8&list=WL&index=1&t=8450s)
